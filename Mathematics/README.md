# Mathematics

In Cheddar, mathematical functions are all operators. This is to make mathematics more idomatic, this section covers all mathematical operations in Cheddar.

 - The operators and behaviors as described in this section applies to `number`s. Any number made through a number literal is of class `number`.
 
 Most likely any numeric classes have defined overloads for each numeric operator, refer to the class's documentation for more information
 - All operators are left-associative unless otherwise specified
 
 **Note:** This section only covers mathematical _operators_, reference the Math namespace for more mathematical functions

# Boolean
 A boolean is a value representing a `true` or `false` value. A boolean is **not a variable**, meaning it cannot be treated like a property.

 Syntax for booleans is either `true` or `false`.
 
 ```java
 true
 false
 ```

> #### Info::Alternative for False
> If you don't like using `false`, you may use the `alex` variable which is preinitialized to `false`.

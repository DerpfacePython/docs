# Standard Library API
In order for Standard Library development to be as quick, efficient, and powerful as possible, requiring each file from the depths of the source was not going to be pratical. For this reason, an API has been created, which can be accessed by using the following template:

```js
export default function(cheddar) {
    // API is now exposed as `cheddar`
}
```

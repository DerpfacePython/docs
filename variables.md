# Variables & Constants

A variable is a named representation of some section of memory. Variables are used to store values, one of the most fundamental part of any program. Some examples of declaring variables are:

```js
var my_variable := 123
var my_variable : Number = 123

const my_constant := 123
const my_constant : Number = 123
```

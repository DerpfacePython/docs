# Literals

The most fundamental of any language are its literals. Cheddar provides the 4 most basic literals:

 - Strings
 - Numbers
 - Booleans
 - Arrays

## Strings
 Strings in Cheddar are like most programming languages:
 
 ```ruby
 "Hello, World!"
 'Hello, World!'
 "2 + 2 = #{2+2}"
 '10 + 10 = #{10+10}'
 ```
 
 ## Numbers
 Numbers have many features in Cheddar to make them readable and clear:
 
 ```swift
123
123.456
123_456
0b123
 ```
 
 ## Arrays
 
 Arrays in Cheddar are like most other languages:
 
 ```c
 [1,2,3]
 ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
 ```
 
 ## Booleans
 Booleans are either:
 ```
 true
 false
 ```

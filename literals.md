# Literals

The most fundamental of any language are its literals. Cheddar provides the 4 most basic literals:

 - Strings
 - Numbers
 - Booleans
 - Arrays

## Strings
 Strings in Cheddar are like most programming languages:
 
 ```ruby
 "Hello, World!"
 'Hello, World!'
 "2 + 2 = #{2+2}"
 '10 + 10 = #{10+10}'
 ```

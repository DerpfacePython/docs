## What is a Namespace?

**A namespace is a scope**, not even a glorified scope, just a plain scope assigned to a variable. What are the uses of namespaces? Namespaces are useful to avoid cluttering the parent scope and can be used where a class is not applicable. Some examples of namespace usage in the standard library includes:

 - `Math`, which stores constants and useful functions
 - `IO`, which stores I/O functions and constants
